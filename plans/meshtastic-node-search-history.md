# Meshtastic/Meshcore: node search + stored message history (issue #270)

Status: **proposed, awaiting approval.** No code written yet. Follows the
regression fix shipped in v2.33.41 (mesh dashboards were missing core scripts).

## Context

#270 (split from #253, plus @bob1234uk's comments) asks for two features on the
Meshtastic dashboard (and, where it applies, Meshcore):

1. **Node search / Nodes tab** — many nodes never appear on the map (they have no
   position), and there's no way to look one up. Add a searchable node list.
2. **Existing/stored message history** — the app only shows messages received
   *after* it connected; show what's already stored on the node too.

## Current state (grounded)

- `/meshtastic/nodes` (`loadNodes()`) already returns every node the device
  knows, and it's called on connect. But the dashboard only turns nodes into
  **map markers when they have a position** (`updateNodeMarker`); there is **no
  node-list UI**. The `meshNode*` element ids are the *own-node* panel, not a
  list of the mesh.
- `/meshtastic/messages` (`loadMessages()`, called on connect) returns
  `_recent_messages` — "messages received **since the listener was started**."
  It does **not** read the device's persisted store, which is why history from
  before the app connected never shows.

## Part 1 — Nodes tab with search (mostly frontend)

- Add a **Nodes** tab to the dashboard's tabbed side panel (between Messages and
  Channels), rendering all nodes from `/meshtastic/nodes`:
  - Columns/fields: name (long/short), node id, last-heard (relative), SNR/RSSI,
    hops-away, battery, and a position indicator.
  - **Search box** filtering by name or node id (live).
  - Click a node → if it has a position, centre/zoom the map on it and open its
    marker; always show its details (reuse the existing node popup content).
  - Show a clear "no position" state for nodes that can't be mapped (bob's main
    pain point — they exist only in the list).
- Backend: confirm `/meshtastic/nodes` already includes last-heard + SNR + hops;
  if any are missing from the serialized node, enrich the response from the
  meshtastic lib's node DB (`interface.nodes`). Likely small.
- Meshcore already has a Nodes/Contacts panel + tabs; assess whether it needs
  the same search affordance or already covers this.

## Part 2 — Stored message history (backend-led)

- The device retains a limited recent message history; the meshtastic Python lib
  surfaces prior text messages during the initial connect/node-DB sync. On
  connect, capture those and seed `_recent_messages` (or a separate
  "stored"-tagged list) so `loadMessages()` returns them.
- Investigate exactly what the lib exposes on connect (packet log vs. a message
  store) — this is device/firmware-dependent, so the deliverable may be
  "history as far back as the device provides," not unlimited.
- Frontend: render seeded history in the feed, visually distinguishable from
  live messages if useful (e.g. a subtle "history" divider). De-dup against live
  messages that also arrive.
- Optional: expose received-packet history (beyond text) if the lib provides it;
  scope carefully to avoid a firehose.

## Sequencing

**270a — Nodes tab + search** first: higher value (bob's headline ask), mostly
frontend, low risk, no device-history uncertainty.
**270b — Stored history** second: needs meshtastic-lib investigation and is
inherently best-effort (bounded by what the device retains).

## Verification

- Unit/route tests for any `/meshtastic/nodes` enrichment and a history-seed
  endpoint/param.
- Playwright: Nodes tab renders injected nodes, search filters, clicking a
  positioned node centres the map, a position-less node shows the no-map state.
- `tests/test_dashboard_scripts.py` already guards the dashboard's script deps.
- **Hardware check required** for Part 2 especially: what history actually comes
  back is device-dependent and can't be verified here — @bob1234uk to confirm.

## Open questions

1. Nodes tab for **both** Meshtastic and Meshcore, or Meshtastic first?
   (Meshcore already has a contacts/nodes panel.)
2. History depth: seed into the existing feed, or a separate "History" view?
3. Include non-text received packets, or text messages only for now?
